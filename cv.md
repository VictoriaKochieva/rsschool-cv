## Summary ##

Iâ€™m going to start working as a Front-End Developer programming and I am an excellent fit for it: I'm an ambitious  creative person who loves to
set goals and achieve them - 
as evidence of this qualities  I have my own business in the field of selling children's goods.

I always find different approaches to solving any problems, and I also love non-standard solutions.
